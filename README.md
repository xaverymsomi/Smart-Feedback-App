Final Project Idea: “Smart Feedback App”

🔨 Updated Stack for the Smart Feedback App

Part	                  Tech
Frontend	              React
Backend	                Node.js + Express
Database	              MySQL
AI	                    Hugging Face Sentiment Analysis API
Deployment	(Optional) Netlify + Render/Railway

What it does:
Users submit feedback or reviews → AI (Hugging Face) analyzes the sentiment → Admin sees analytics & can respond.

You’ll learn:

React (frontend, forms, state, routing)

Node.js + Express (backend API, routing, MongoDB)

Connecting frontend & backend (API calls)

Storing data (MongoDB)

Using Hugging Face API to analyze feedback

Deployment (Netlify + Render/Heroku)

🧱 Project Plan + Learning Path
📚 Phase 1: Basics Before Project (1 week)
Goal: Be comfortable with React & Node basics.

🔹 React Basics
Topics to learn:

What is React?

Components & Props

State & Events

JSX

Fetching Data with fetch or axios

Resources:

React Official Docs – “Main Concepts”

YouTube: Net Ninja React Series

Try mini projects:

A counter app

A basic to-do list

🔹 Node.js + Express Basics
Topics:

What is Node.js?

Setting up Express server

Creating routes (GET, POST)

Middleware

Connecting MongoDB with Mongoose

Resources:

Node.js + Express Crash Course (Traversy Media)

MongoDB Atlas (free cloud DB)

Try mini projects:

Simple API that returns JSON

Notes API with save & retrieve

🔨 Phase 2: Smart Feedback App (Hands-on)
Step 1: Setup Project Structure
bash
Copy
Edit
/smart-feedback-app
  /client (React)
  /server (Node + Express)
We’ll go into each step deeply when you're ready.

Step 2: React App (Frontend)
Features:

Feedback form (user types review)

Submit to backend

Show analysis result (e.g. “Positive”, “Negative”)

Admin dashboard (see all feedback)

Tech:

React Router for pages

Axios for API calls

Context or useState for managing state

Step 3: Node Backend
Features:

REST API to accept feedback

Save to MongoDB

Route to analyze feedback using Hugging Face

Tech:

Express.js

Mongoose for MongoDB

Dotenv for secrets

Hugging Face API call

Step 4: Hugging Face Integration
We’ll use 🤗 Hugging Face's sentiment model via REST API.

Register on https://huggingface.co

Get API Token

Use this model: distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english

Request:

bash
Copy
Edit
POST https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
Send:

json
Copy
Edit
{"inputs": "I love this product!"}
Response:

json
Copy
Edit
[
  {
    "label": "POSITIVE",
    "score": 0.99
  }
]
We’ll write the backend route to fetch this and return to React.

Step 5: Deployment (Optional but Powerful)
Frontend: Netlify or Vercel

Backend: Render.com or Railway.app

Database: MongoDB Atlas

🧠 After That...
You’ll understand:

Fullstack web app flow (frontend <-> backend <-> AI)

Working with APIs

Deploying your own app

Then we can:

Add authentication

Add charts

Export data

Improve AI (e.g., summarization or emotion detection)
